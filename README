django-fixturapp
================

An utility app that integrates Kumar McMillan's great Fixture module with Django.


Usage
=====

1. Include Fixturapp on your site's INSTALLED_APPS list.

2. Try ``python manage.py help`` to see if the ``fixturapp_*`` commands are now available.

3. Inside each Django app you wish, create a ``datasets`` package with your fixtures.

4. To fill your database with fixture data, run ``python manage.py fixturapp_loadall``.


How it works
============

Fixturapp exports a new command ``fixturapp_loadall`` to your ``manage.py``.

This command searchs for a ``datasets`` module inside each INSTALLED_APPS and loads the found dataset classes into the databse.
