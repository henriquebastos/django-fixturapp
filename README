django-fixturapp
================

Fixturapp is an utility app that brings Django management commands to
integrates the great Fixture module with your Django Project.

Check the Fixture module at http://www.farmdev.com/projects/fixture/


Why
===

For some cases, managing Django Fixtures can be very cumbersome. Since it's
centered on dumping existent data from the database, fixtures have predefined
primary key value.

When you need complex sets of initial data, it can be really annoying and
error prone to change manually generated initial data or keep regenerating
them.

The Fixture module solves those problems.


Install
=======

To install django-fixturapp you will need setuptools:

	git clone http://github.com/henriquebastos/diango-fixturapp
    cd /path/to/repo
    python setup.py install

To run Fixture's own test suite you need to create a buildout:

    python setup.py
    ./bin/buildout

Then you can run the tests with:

    ./bin/test


Usage
=====

1. Include Fixturapp on your site's INSTALLED_APPS list.

2. Try ``python manage.py help`` to see if the ``fixturapp_*`` commands are
   now available.

3. Inside each Django app you wish, create a ``datasets`` package with your
   fixtures.

4. To fill your database with fixture data, run
   ``python manage.py fixturapp_loadall``.
